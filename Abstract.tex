Phishing attacks are growing in sophistication by deploying diverse evasion techniques to avoid detection by blacklist entities. The browser-based anti-phishing methods could potentially protect millions of people from phishing attacks. Blacklists, reactive-based methods, suffer from significant shortcomings. Attackers exploit these weaknesses and continue to ..
Proactive anti-phishing methods are deployed in modern browsers to cover the blacklists' protection leaks. The core of these heuristic anti-phishing methods are the classifiers. In this paper, we present a methodical evaluation of client-side anti-phishing mechanisms. We found that client-side content-based anti-phishing does not contribute to blacklisting. We also analyzed the privacy-preserving in the client-side anti-phishing.
